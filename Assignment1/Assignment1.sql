-- Inner Join 
-- The result of the join can be defined as the outcome of first taking the 
-- Cartesian product of all records in the tables (combining every record in 
-- table A with every record in table B)â€”then return all records which satisfy the join predicate.
-- Selects those employees from employees table which also have a corresponding entry in dept_manager table.

-- table A, even if the join-condition does not find any matching record in table B. 
-- Select all the departments and those dept_manager which satisfy the condition . Null is inserted incase no mathing tuple is found
-- in the right table for a tuple in left table. If more than one is found then the entries in the left table is repeated.

-- Right Outer Join 
-- Same as left outer join only the treatment of tables is reversed. 
-- Now all entries from the right table us included and only matching entries from the left table is included . Null is inserted if 
-- no matching entry is found.

-- Full Outer Join 
-- Combines result of left and right outer joins.
-- It will contains all the entries from all the tables with null values for not matching entries.
